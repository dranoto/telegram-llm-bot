He descended through three levels of legitimate commerce—past the chrome-lit boutiques and the synth-food stalls—until the air turned thick with ozone and desperation. Here, in the Gutters, the black market breathed through gills of steam pipes and flickering sodium lamps.\n\nKael adjusted his coat, the synthetic fabric heavy enough to hide the dead weight of his right arm. The prosthetic whirred softly, a nervous habit, as he approached the unmarked hatch beneath the recycling plant’s main converter. Three knocks, pause, two knocks. The metal scraped open.\n\n“Voss,” rasped the doorman, a man whose eyes had been replaced with milky optical implants. “The Clockmaker wasn’t sure you’d come.”\n\n“Marn owes me a favor,” Kael said, stepping into the warmth. “And I’m here to collect.”\n\nThe interior was a cathedral of violence. Weapons lined every surface—pulse rifles hung like smoked hams, plasma casters gleamed under plastic sheeting, and crates of ammunition were stacked like brickwork. But Kael ignored them all. He had come for something specific, something that couldn’t be found on any manifest or military database.\n\nMarn “The Clockmaker” sat hunched over a workbench in the back, his magnifying goggles reflecting the blue flame of a micro-torch. He was a small man, made smaller by the hunch of his shoulders, with fingers stained black from gun oil and cordite. He didn’t look up when Kael approached.\n\n“You’re late,” Marn said, his voice high and tight.\n\n“Traffic above,” Kael replied. “You have it?”\n\nMarn set down the torch. From beneath the workbench, he withdrew a case made of matte-gray ceramite. The locks disengaged with a hiss of pressurized air. Inside, nestled in velvet the color of dried blood, lay the sidearm.\n\nIt was a Harkonnen Model-7 needler, but barely recognizable as the standard-issue assassination tool used by corporate security teams. Marn had stripped it down to its skeleton and rebuilt it with obsessive precision. The barrel was extended by four inches, threaded for a suppressor that could make a gunshot sound like a sigh. The grip was custom-fitted, wrapped in leather tanned from something that definitely wasn’t cowhide, and inset with a biometric scanner that pulsed with a faint amber light.\n\nBut the real beauty was in the magazine. Kael picked it up—light, perfectly balanced—and ejected the clip. Instead of standard flechettes, the rounds were crystalline, filled with a frozen compound that Marn called “void-ice.” On impact, the rounds wouldn’t just penetrate; they would flash-freeze the target’s blood and shatter the surrounding tissue into pink mist. No exit wounds. No ballistic evidence. Just a corpse with a hole the size of a credit chip and organs that looked like they’d been left in a winter storm.\n\n“It’s called the Whisper-End,” Marn said, finally looking up. His eyes were bloodshot, dancing with the manic energy of a man who’d spent seventy-two hours without sleep perfecting his craft. “Biometric lock is keyed to your DNA—took a sample from the glass you used last time you were here. Won’t fire for anyone else. Not even if they cut off your hand. The void-ice rounds are stable to negative forty degrees. Any colder, they’ll shatter; any warmer, they’ll expand and jam the barrel. Keep it in the cold-storage rig I’ve built into the holster.”\n\nKael turned the weapon over in his hands. His synthetic fingers clicked against the alloy frame. “How many rounds?”\n\n“Twelve in the magazine, one in the chamber. Thirteen total. I could only synthesize thirteen rounds of the void-ice compound. The chemistry is… unstable. Volatile. After thirteen shots, the barrel residue will contaminate any standard ammunition you try to feed it. It becomes a very expensive paperweight.”\n\n“Thirteen shots,” Kael murmured. He sighted down the barrel, the crosshair hologram flickering to life and painting a red dot on the far wall. “Thirteen bounties.”\n\n“Or one very important bounty,” Marn corrected. He wiped his hands on a rag that left more grease than it removed. “The target you mentioned. The one with the regeneration implant. Standard rounds just heal up, don’t they? But void-ice crystallizes the cells. No healing from that. Not even with military-grade nanotech.”\n\nKael thumbed the safety, feeling the weapon hum as it recognized his biometrics. The amber light turned green. “Price?”\n\n“Fifty thousand credits. And the marker you hold on my life. I want it erased.”\n\nKael stared at the little gunsmith. The marker was worth more than the credits—a favor from a man who could build ghosts in metal form. But Kael had been hunting Sebastian Vane for eight months, and Vane’s Cortisol Regeneration made him immune to conventional damage. The Whisper-End was the only thing that could freeze the bastard’s heart long enough to collect the bounty.\n\n“Done,” Kael said.\n\nHe transferred the credits from his neural wallet, watching Marn flinch as the confirmation pinged in his optic nerve. Then Kael produced a data chip—the marker, encoded with Marn’s genetic debt—and crushed it between his synthetic fingers. The ceramic dust drifted down like snow.\n\nMarn exhaled, his shoulders dropping three inches. “The holster is magnetized to your belt rig. Cold storage will keep the rounds stable for six hours without power. After that…”\n\n“I won’t need six hours,” Kael said, sliding the Whisper-End into the holster at the small of his back. The cold immediately seeped through his coat, a chill promise against his spine. “Vane is hosting a charity gala tonight. He thinks he’s untouchable behind his walls and his guards and his fancy regeneration tech.”\n\n“He’ll see you coming,” Marn warned.\n\n“He’ll see me,” Kael agreed, turning toward the hatch. “But he won’t hear me.”\n\nThe doorman let him out into the steam and shadow. Above, the city roared with life—hovercars and neon and the endless noise of ten million people fighting to survive another day. But down here, in the Gutters, Kael walked in silence. He had twelve shots for the guards, and one perfect, frozen bullet for Sebastian Vane.\n\nThirteen shots. Thirteen reasons to believe that some debts could only be paid in ice.\n\nHe vanished into the dark, the Whisper-End cold against his back, counting down the hours until the killing would begin."}],"presets":{"1":{"model":"qwen/qwen3.5-397b-a17b-thinking","system_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant."},"2":{"model":"zai-org/glm-5:thinking","system_prompt":"You"},"3":{"model":"moonshotai/kimi-k2.5:thinking","system_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant."}}}
