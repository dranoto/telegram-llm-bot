Kael Voss descended the maintenance ladder with the silence of a falling knife, her trench coat heavy with the humidity of the subterranean bazaar. Down here, beneath the platinum mines and above the station's waste recyclers, the Black Veil market operated on its own time—twenty-six hours of perpetual twilight illuminated by cracked neon tubes and chem-luminescent fungi.\n\nShe found the stall between a vendor selling expired oxygen filters and a surgeon who specialized in unlicensed neural implants. No sign, just a rusted shipping container with its doors thrown open to reveal velvet-lined shelves. The merchant, a wiry man with cybernetic eyes that whirred and clicked as they focused, looked up from his tablet. His name was Finch, though that changed monthly.\n\n\"You're late,\" Finch said, his voice modulated by a vocal scrambler.\n\n\"Traffic,\" Kael replied, though neither of them smiled.\n\nShe didn't sit. In the Veil, sitting meant surrendering mobility. Instead, she leaned against the corrugated metal wall, her hand never straying far from the holster at her thigh. Finch noticed the gesture—everyone in their line of work noticed everything.\n\n\"You have the specifications?\" Finch asked.\n\n\"Biometric lock, ceramic-composite frame, zero-recoil compensators,\" Kael recited. \"But mostly, I need the ammunition.\"\n\nFinch's mechanical eyes dilated. \"The caseless rounds. Armor-piercing with disruptor cores. Expensive tastes, Voss.\"\n\n\"Not tastes,\" she corrected. \"Necessities.\"\n\nThe target was named Ezekiel Crowe, and he traveled with a Class-V kinetic barrier that turned conventional firearms into expensive noisemakers. The Consortium had placed a bounty of fifty thousand credits on his head—alive, unfortunately, which complicated matters. Kael needed something that could punch through his personal shield without turning his skull into vapor.\n\nFinch disappeared into the shadows of his container. Kael heard the magnetic seal of a lockbox disengage, then the hiss of pressurized nitrogen. When Finch returned, he carried a case the color of burnt gunmetal. He set it on the counter between them with ceremonial care.\n\nThe Valkyrie Arms Model-9 didn't look like much at first glance. It was matte black, compact enough to disappear beneath a coat, with a grip that seemed too wide for its frame. But the barrel—extended by three inches and threaded with micro-coils—told the story. This wasn't a weapon designed for street thugs or corporate security. This was a precision instrument built to kill people who really didn't want to die.\n\n\"Serial numbers filed off, of course,\" Finch said, running a finger along the slide. \"Custom fabricated on Titan. The ammunition uses phase-shifting technology—three milliseconds of molecular instability that lets the round pass through energy barriers before solidifying inside the target's chest cavity.\"\n\n\"Range?\"\n\n\"Effective at forty meters. Beyond that, the phase-shift becomes unstable. But within forty meters?\" Finch made a sound like a cracking whip. \"Crowe's shield might as well be wet paper.\"\n\nKael reached out, not touching the gun yet, but hovering her hand above it. She could feel the faint vibration of the magnetic accelerators charging in standby mode. It was beautiful. It was also illegal in seventeen systems.\n\n\"Price,\" she said.\n\n\"Twelve thousand,\" Finch replied.\n\n\"Three.\"\n\n\"Don't insult me. These rounds cost two hundred credits each to manufacture. The gun itself is a work of art.\"\n\n\"Five,\" Kael said. \"And I don't tell the Syndicate that you're the one who sold the Ambassador's son those military-grade implants last month.\"\n\nFinch's mechanical eyes stopped whirring. In the sudden silence, a dripping sound echoed from somewhere in the cavernous dark beyond his stall.\n\n\"Seven,\" Finch said quietly. \"And you forget the Ambassador's son.\"\n\n\"Done.\"\n\nKael transferred the credits from her wrist-mounted chip, watching the numbers disappear from her account with the finality of a closing coffin. In this business, hardware was more reliable than retirement funds. Finch verified the transfer, then pushed the case toward her.\n\n\"One magazine,\" he warned. \"Twelve rounds. That's all I could acquire without drawing attention. The manufacturing facility on Titan suffered an unfortunate fire three days ago.\"\n\n\"Convenient,\" Kael said, checking the weapon's weight. It balanced perfectly, the biometric sensors in the grip already mapping her palm print.\n\n\"For you, perhaps. For the workers on Titan, less so.\"\n\nKael loaded the magazine. The rounds were heavier than they looked, dense cores of tungsten wrapped in unstable energy cells. She holstered the weapon at the small of her back, feeling the slight warmth of the power cell against her spine.\n\n\"Crowe knows you're coming,\" Finch said suddenly. He was cleaning an imaginary spot from his counter, not meeting her eyes. \"He's hired the Silver Hand. Three of them.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"He's also augmented. Military-grade reflexes, subdermal plating under the skin. That gun will get you through his shield, Voss, but you'll still need to hit something vital before he tears your heart out.\"\n\nKael adjusted her coat. \"Then I'll aim for the head.\"\n\nShe turned to leave, but Finch's voice stopped her at the container's edge. \"Why him, Voss? Fifty thousand isn't worth going against the Silver Hand. Not for a rational person.\"\n\nKael paused in the doorway, the neon from the oxygen filter vendor painting her face in shades of toxic green. \"Three years ago, Crowe ran a slaving operation on the outer rim. Sold sixty colonists to the Kharak for pit mining. One of them was my sister.\"\n\nShe didn't look back to see Finch's reaction. She didn't need to. In the Black Veil, everyone had ghosts. Everyone bought weapons for reasons that had nothing to do with money.\n\nAs she climbed back toward the station's upper levels, the Model-9 heavy and reassuring against her spine, Kael felt the old familiar calm settle over her. Tomorrow, she would find Crowe. Tomorrow, she would test whether twelve rounds were enough to bring down a man who thought himself invincible.\n\nBut tonight, she had a weapon that could kill ghosts. And in her experience, that was the only thing worth buying in places like this."}],"presets":{"1":{"model":"qwen/qwen3.5-397b-a17b-thinking","system_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant."},"2":{"model":"zai-org/glm-5:thinking","system_prompt":"You"},"3":{"model":"moonshotai/kimi-k2.5:thinking","system_prompt":"You are a helpful assistant."}}}
